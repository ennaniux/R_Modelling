* Task 1

Suppose we have collected the following information
#+begin_src R
AA <- c(
33.62 ,37.80, 24.31, 34.97, 21.81, 27.36, 12.45, 34.20, 39.60, 39.47, 29.14, 38.11,
42.26 , 6.86, 36.64, 55.42, 22.37, 15.66, 31.29, 30.81, 34.53, 28.56, 26.69, 40.48,
22.34 ,33.56, 22.60, 18.48, 32.01, 33.22, 14.13, 24.02, 33.88, 32.07, 17.94, 28.51,
29.11 ,41.72, 51.78, 38.59, 31.11, 31.30, 27.04, 28.37, 24.88, 39.63, 18.73, 34.48,
29.73 ,11.47, 24.58, 28.14, 32.43, 10.85, 44.03, 26.83, 24.30, 19.60, 20.57, 40.13,
37.04 ,31.42, 34.40, 35.09, 32.87, 32.78, 31.24, 19.80, 10.14, 35.69, 24.07, 23.12,
35.25 ,26.85, 28.42, 26.53, 12.67, 23.82, 19.45, 22.21, 31.03, 44.85, 16.91, 41.76,
27.94 ,22.51, 23.44, 35.41, 30.00, 47.13, 22.98, 38.17, 14.74, 40.43, 27.96, 26.06,

If we knew that the standard deviation of this parameter on the population is $\sigma=3$ compute
a 95% Confidence interval (C.I), assuming the data is normally distributed.

* Task 2

Solve the problem in Task 1, but now consider that we do not know the value of the standard deviation.

* Task 3

A) Take a sample of size $n =10$ from the data in Task 1. Now we cannot longer assume the data is normally distributed.
Compute the 90% CI.

B) Compare your previous result with what you get using the function =t.test=.



* Task 4

Given a sample of size $n = 9$, suppose that your sample mean equals =3.12=. If your sample variance is =1.37=, find the 95% confidence interval for the population mean \mu.

* Task 5

A candidate is running for election. Her advisor team conduct a poll,
to determine if she is likely to win. Out of 200 voters contacted, 105
indicate that they will vote for her, and the other 95 indicate that
they will vote for her opponent.

a) Find a 95% confidence interval for the proportion of the population who intend to vote for her.
b) What is the probability that she will win, based on this sample?
c) How many voters should be included in the sample so that the margin of error is within 3%?

      

* Task 6

Plot the chi-square probability density function for different degrees of freedom and obtain something similar to this image
