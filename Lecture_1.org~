* Introduction to R

- What is R?

R is an open source statistical software.

- How to get it?

You can get R directly on their website [[https://www.r-project.org/]]

- What is RStudio?

RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R. 

It is a good tool to get started if you are not used to scripting programming. It has very helpful visual messages. 

I use [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][emacs]] and it is difficult for me to get used to Rstudio.

 - Installation and packages

The Packages are sets of tools that can be downloaded from different
servers around the world. Different packages have different R functions for specific purposes.

For example, the foreign package allows R to read different data set files like .sav, .dbf, and other file extensions.

In order to install the package foreign we type in the console
#+begin_example R
install.packages("foreign")
#+end_example

this will provide a list of possible servers to choose from, and you
can select one close to your location.
