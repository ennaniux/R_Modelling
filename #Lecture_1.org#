* Introduction to R

- What is R?

R is an open source statistical software.

- How to get it?

You can get R directly on their website [[https://www.r-project.org/]]

- What is RStudio?

RStudio is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R. 

It is a good tool to get started if you are not used to scripting programming. It has very helpful visual features.

I use [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][emacs]] and it is difficult for me to get used to Rstudio. My advice: use whatever you find more comfortable. 



 + Basic commands
   + getwd()
   + setwd()
   + install.packages()
   + library()
   + df <- read.dbf()
   + df$NAME
   + dim(df)
   + class(df)
   + ls()
   + rm(list=ls())
   + sum(df$NAME)
   + as.numeric()
   + as.character()
   + df$NEWVAR <- df$NAME
   + table()
   + tapply, sapply, lapply, etc.


* The Working Directory

Get my Working Directory (a.k.a. where am I?)
#+begin_example R
getwd()
#+end_example


Set my Working Directory (a.k.a. change directory)
#+begin_example R
setwd("/home/ennaniux/Documents/R_Modelling")
#+end_example

How does this work in Windows?
#+begin_example R
setwd("C:/home/ennaniux/Documents/R_Modelling")
#+end_example

or maybe 
#+begin_example R
setwd("C:\\home\\ennaniux\\Documents\\R_Modelling")
#+end_example


* Installing packages

The Packages are sets of tools that can be downloaded from different
servers around the world. Different packages have different R functions for specific purposes.

For example, the foreign package allows R to read different data set files like .sav, .dbf, and other file extensions.

In order to install the package foreign we type in the console
#+begin_example R
install.packages("foreign")
#+end_example

this will provide a list of possible servers to choose from, and you
can select one close to your location.


* Writing a data frame

Write a data frame by specifying the columns:

#+begin_src R 
df <- data.frame(
"NAME" =  c("Aleksandra", "Hugo", "Piotr", "Ewa"),
"AGE"  =  c(29,35, 39, 33),
"HEIGHT"= c(1.68, 1.83, 2.03, 1.66) )
df
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
| Aleksandra | 29 | 1.68 |
| Hugo       | 35 | 1.83 |
| Piotr      | 39 | 2.03 |
| Ewa        | 33 | 1.66 |



What is the dimension of the data frame?
#+begin_src R 
dim(df)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

What are te variable names of the data frame?
#+begin_src R 
names(df)
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:


 - Graphics
 - Reading data
 - Markdown
